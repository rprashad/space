Container::INI - a small pure perl lib with zero deps that takes an INI file name as an argument and creates some serious data structures/objects.
                 I'm sure a number of these exist, but this version supports dot notation for keys which will nest your structure
		 quite nicely.  Additionally we're smart about commas and constructing arrays and such (can be escaped with \). Multiline support 
		 is available (\).
